"""Completion notifications: run a wrapped command and report how it ended.

`chime when <command>` runs a command as a foreground child with inherited

**Completion result** describing how it ended. The alert itself is delivered by
`alerts.deliver()`; this module owns the trigger (process exit) and a plain
default rendering, per ADR-0004.
